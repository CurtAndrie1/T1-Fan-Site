                <p class="ano">The objective of Summoner's Rift is simple â€“ destroy the enemy nexus. In order to do this, champions must traverse down one of three different paths (or lanes) in order to attack their enemy at their weakest points they can exploit. Both teams have their lanes defended by numerous turrets; each turret grows in strength the closer it gets to its respective nexus and each turret must be eliminated in order to gain access to the next turret in that lane. Cooperating with fellow summoners is an absolute requirement for success, as it is easy for a champion to find themselves ambushed by enemies in the lanes of the Rift.</p>

            <p class="ano">ARAM, abbreviation of All Random, All Mid, is a game mode in League of Legends in a 5v5 format on the  Howling Abyss, where the objective is to destroy the opposing team's Nexus. 
                The game includes an  All random draft type, and takes place only on one long lane (specifically referencing its resemblance to  Summoner's Rift's middle lane).

            <p class="ano">Ultra Rapid Fire (U.R.F.) is a Featured Game Mode played on  Summoner's Rift where all champions are able to use their abilities and spells very frequently and without costs, accelerating the pace of the match. All champions in this mode have a permanent buff that adds many adjustments to how the game is played. The two main effects granted by this buff are 300 ability haste (equivalent to 75% cooldown reduction) and the removal of all mana and energy costs from abilities.</p>

                Unmodified basic attacks' damage against the Nexus is 100% base AD (+ 100% bonus AD) (+ 60% AP). The damage type depends on ability power and bonus attack damage:</p>
